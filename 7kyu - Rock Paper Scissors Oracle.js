// You are the rock paper scissors oracle.

// Famed throughout the land, you have the incredible ability to predict which hand gestures your opponent will choose out of rock, paper and scissors.

// Unfortunately you're no longer a youngster, and have trouble moving your hands between rounds. For this reason, you can only pick a single gesture for each opponent. If it's possible for you to win, you will, but you're also happy to tie.

// Given an array of gestures — for example ["paper", "scissors", "scissors"] — return the winning gesture/s in the order in which they appear in the title, separated by a forward slash. For example, if rock and scissors could both be used to win you would return:

// "rock/scissors"

// If it's not possible for you to win then return:

// "tie"
